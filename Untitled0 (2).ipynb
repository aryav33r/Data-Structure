        "Data structures are a way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are used to store and manipulate data in a way that allows for specific operations, such as searching, inserting, deleting, or updating elements, to be performed quickly and in an optimized manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Data Structures:\n",
        "1. **Linear Data Structures:**\n",
        "   - Arrays\n",
        "   - Linked Lists\n",
        "   - Stacks\n",
        "   - Queues\n",
        "2. **Non-linear Data Structures:**\n",
        "   - Trees (e.g., binary trees, AVL trees, etc.)\n",
        "   - Graphs (e.g., directed, undirected, weighted graphs)\n",
        "3. **Hash-Based Data Structures:**\n",
        "   - Hash Tables\n",
        "   - Hash Maps\n",

        "### Importance of Data Structures:\n",
        "1. **Efficiency in Storing and Accessing Data:**\n",
        "   - Different data structures are optimized for different types of operations. For example, arrays allow fast access to elements via indices, while linked lists allow fast insertions and deletions.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Improved Performance:**\n",
        "   - Choosing the right data structure can greatly impact the performance of an application. For example, searching in a sorted array can be done faster using binary search, while searching in an unsorted array takes linear time.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Memory Optimization:**\n",
        "   - Data structures like linked lists and trees allow dynamic memory allocation, reducing wasted space compared to static structures like arrays.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Organizing Complex Data:**\n",
        "   - Data structures like graphs and trees allow the representation of complex relationships, such as hierarchical data or networks.\n",
        "   \n",
        "5. **Algorithmic Efficiency:**\n",
        "   - Many algorithms are based on specific data structures (e.g., Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm uses a priority queue). The efficiency of these algorithms is closely tied to how the data is organized.\n",
        "   \n",
        "6. **Real-world Applications:**\n",
        "   - Data structures are the foundation of many software applications and systems. For example, databases use B-trees and hash tables for indexing, while compilers use stacks to manage function calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, data structures are essential for optimizing the performance, memory usage, and scalability of programs and systems, making them a fundamental concept in computer science and software engineering.\n",

        "### Why It Matters:\n",
        "- **Mutable data types** are useful when you need to modify the contents of an object in place. They allow for more flexible manipulation, but can sometimes introduce unexpected behavior (e.g., when sharing the same object across multiple parts of a program).\n",
        "- **Immutable data types** are important for ensuring that data remains constant and reliable. They help prevent accidental changes to the data, which can lead to bugs, and are often used in situations where the integrity of data is critical (e.g., in functional programming or concurrent programming).\n",

        "\n",
        "3.What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python4\n",
        "In Python, both **lists** and **tuples** are used to store collections of items. However, there are key differences between them that impact how they are used and behave in programs. Here’s a comparison of the main differences between **lists** and **tuples**:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Mutability**\n",
        "   - **Lists** are **mutable**, meaning their contents can be changed after the list is created. You can add, remove, or change elements in a list.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "     my_list[0] = 10  # Change an element\n",
        "     my_list.append(4)  # Add an element\n",
        "     print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - **Tuples** are **immutable**, meaning once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. Any attempt to modify, add, or remove elements will raise an error.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "     # my_tuple[0] = 10  # This would raise an error: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Syntax**\n",
        "   - **Lists** are created using square brackets `[]`.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - **Tuples** are created using parentheses `()`.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     - A **single-item tuple** requires a trailing comma to differentiate it from a regular value in parentheses.\n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       single_item_tuple = (1,)  # A tuple with one element\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Performance**\n",
        "   - **Lists** have a slightly higher overhead due to their mutability, which means they can be slower when performing operations that involve modifying the list.\n",
        "   - **Tuples** are generally **faster** than lists because they are immutable, and their fixed size allows for optimizations in terms of memory and speed. When performing read-only operations (accessing elements), tuples can be more efficient than lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Methods and Functionality**\n",
        "   - **Lists** provide a wide range of built-in methods for modifying their contents, such as:\n",
        "     - `append()`, `remove()`, `insert()`, `pop()`, `extend()`, and more.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "     my_list.append(4)  # Add an item\n",
        "     my_list.remove(2)  # Remove an item\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - **Tuples** have only two methods:\n",
        "     - `count()` and `index()`, which are used to count occurrences and find the index of elements, respectively.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 1)\n",
        "     print(my_tuple.count(1))  # Output: 2\n",
        "     print(my_tuple.index(2))  # Output: 1\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Use Cases**\n",
        "   - **Lists** are used when you need a collection of items that might change over time, such as adding or removing elements dynamically. They are great for tasks where data changes frequently.\n",
        "   - **Tuples** are used when you want to ensure that the collection of items remains constant. They are useful for representing fixed collections of data, such as coordinates, records, or return values from functions. Tuples are also often used as keys in dictionaries (because they are hashable), whereas lists cannot be used as dictionary keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Memory Efficiency**\n",
        "   - **Lists** consume more memory due to their flexibility and additional features for dynamic size adjustments and mutability.\n",
        "   - **Tuples** consume less memory because of their immutability. The fixed structure allows Python to allocate memory more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Immutability and Hashability**\n",
        "   - **Lists** are **not hashable** and therefore cannot be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets because they can be modified.\n",
        "   - **Tuples** are **hashable** (as long as their elements are hashable), meaning they can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_dict = { (1, 2): \"value\" }  # This works, because tuples are hashable\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Iteration**\n",
        "   - Both lists and tuples support iteration (e.g., using loops or comprehensions). However, because tuples are immutable, iterating over a tuple can sometimes be a little faster than iterating over a list.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   for item in my_list:\n",
        "       print(item)\n",
        "   \n",
        "   for item in my_tuple:\n",
        "       print(item)\n",
        "   ```\n",

        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "- Use **lists** when you need a collection of elements that might change over time, with flexible operations to modify the data.\n",
        "- Use **tuples** when you want an immutable collection, which can be more efficient and safer for storing fixed data, especially if the data is used as a dictionary key or in a set.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data\n",
        "In Python, **dictionaries** are a built-in data structure used to store data in the form of **key-value pairs**. Each key in a dictionary is unique, and each key is associated with a value. Dictionaries are highly efficient for looking up data, and they are used for fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data based on keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Dictionaries Store Data:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Key-Value Pair**:\n",
        "   - A dictionary in Python is composed of **key-value pairs**. The **key** is a unique identifier that allows you to access the corresponding **value**.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_dict = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 3}\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     Here, `'apple'`, `'banana'`, and `'orange'` are the keys, and `1`, `2`, and `3` are the values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Underlying Data Structure**:\n",
        "   - **Hash Table**: Internally, Python dictionaries use a data structure called a **hash table** (or hash map) to store the key-value pairs. A hash table is an array-like structure that provides a very efficient way to store and retrieve values based on their keys.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **Hashing**: Each key in a dictionary is passed through a **hash function**. The hash function converts the key into a **hash value** (a fixed-size integer), which is then used to determine the index or position in the underlying array where the corresponding value should be stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "     For example:\n",
        "     - The key `'apple'` might hash to the value `12345`.\n",
        "     - The key `'banana'` might hash to the value `67890`.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   This hash value determines where in the array the key-value pair will be stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Handling Collisions**:\n",
        "   - A **collision** occurs when two different keys hash to the same hash value (i.e., they map to the same index in the array). Python handles collisions using a technique called **open addressing**, specifically **quadratic probing** or **double hashing**.\n",
        "   - When a collision occurs, Python finds the next available spot in the table and stores the new key-value pair there.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Efficiency**:\n",
        "   - **O(1) Average Time Complexity**: Accessing, inserting, or deleting an element in a dictionary typically takes constant time **O(1)** on average. This is due to the efficient hashing mechanism, which allows for direct access to the value using the key.\n",
        "   - In the worst case (e.g., if many collisions occur), operations could take longer (O(n)), but this is rare.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Key-Value Lookup**:\n",
        "   - To retrieve a value from a dictionary, Python uses the key to compute its hash value and directly access the index in the hash table where the value is stored.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_dict = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 3}\n",
        "     print(my_dict['apple'])  # Output: 1\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Memory Structure**:\n",
        "   - The underlying hash table used by dictionaries is **dynamic** in size. When the dictionary grows too large (i.e., when it reaches a certain load factor), Python will automatically resize the table to ensure that it can continue to provide fast access times. This resizing involves creating a new, larger array and rehashing all existing keys to new positions in the new array.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Dictionary Operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Creating a dictionary\n",
        "my_dict = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 3}\n",
        "\n",
        "# Adding a new key-value pair\n",
        "my_dict['grape'] = 4  # O(1) operation\n",
        "\n",
        "# Accessing a value using a key\n",
        "print(my_dict['banana'])  # Output: 2\n",
        "\n",
        "# Checking if a key exists\n",
        "if 'apple' in my_dict:\n",
        "    print(\"Apple is in the dictionary.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Removing a key-value pair\n",
        "del my_dict['orange']  # O(1) operation\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "- **Keys** must be **immutable** types (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples), because the dictionary relies on the hash function to determine the key’s position in the table. **Mutable types** (like lists) cannot be used as dictionary keys.\n",
        "- **Values** in a dictionary can be any type (mutable or immutable), and they do not need to be unique.\n",

        "### Summary of Dictionary Storage:\n",
        "- Python dictionaries use **hash tables** to store key-value pairs.\n",
        "- Keys are hashed to unique hash values, which determine their index in the table.\n",
        "- **Collision handling** ensures that multiple keys that hash to the same location can still be stored.\n",
        "- Dictionaries offer fast **O(1)** average time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, **sets** and **lists** are both used to store collections of items, but they have different characteristics that make them suitable for different use cases. Here's why you might choose to use a **set** instead of a **list**:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences Between Sets and Lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Uniqueness of Elements**:\n",
        "   - **Set**: A set automatically removes **duplicate elements**. If you try to add a duplicate item to a set, it will not be added.\n",
        "   - **List**: A list allows **duplicate elements**, meaning the same item can appear multiple times.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **When to use a set**:\n",
        "   - If you need to ensure that your collection contains only unique elements, such as a collection of user IDs or tags where duplicates are not allowed.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}\n",
        "   print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}  (duplicates removed)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Performance (Membership Testing and Lookups)**:\n",
        "   - **Set**: Checking whether an item is present in a set is **faster** than in a list, with an average time complexity of **O(1)** due to the way sets are implemented using hash tables.\n",
        "   - **List**: Checking for membership in a list takes **O(n)** time because you may need to scan through the entire list to find the item.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **When to use a set**:\n",
        "   - When you need to perform **fast membership testing** (i.e., checking if an item is present) or set operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "   print(2 in my_set)  # Output: True (O(1) lookup time)\n",
        "   \n",
        "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   print(2 in my_list)  # Output: True (O(n) lookup time)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Order of Elements**:\n",
        "   - **Set**: A set is **unordered**, meaning the elements do not maintain any particular order. When you iterate over a set, the order of the items may not be the same as when they were added.\n",
        "   - **List**: A list maintains the **order of elements**. The items in a list are stored in the order they were added.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **When to use a list**:\n",
        "   - When you need to **maintain the order** of elements (e.g., when processing items in the order they were added or when sorting them).\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **When to use a set**:\n",
        "   - When you do not need to care about the **order** of the elements but care about fast membership testing and uniqueness.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Set Operations**:\n",
        "   - **Set**: Sets support efficient **mathematical set operations** like **union**, **intersection**, **difference**, and **symmetric difference**, which are very useful in problems involving relationships between multiple sets.\n",
        "   - **List**: Lists do not natively support set operations; you would need to use loops or list comprehensions to manually implement these operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **When to use a set**:\n",
        "   - When you need to perform operations like **union**, **intersection**, or **difference** between two collections.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "   set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
        "   print(set1 & set2)  # Intersection: {3}\n",
        "   print(set1 | set2)  # Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
        "   print(set1 - set2)  # Difference: {1, 2}\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Mutable and Dynamic Size**:\n",
        "   - **Set**: Sets are **mutable**, meaning you can add and remove elements, but the size of a set automatically adjusts to the number of unique elements.\n",
        "   - **List**: Lists are also mutable and can grow or shrink dynamically, but they can contain duplicate elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Memory Usage**:\n",
        "   - **Set**: Sets generally use more memory compared to lists because they need to store additional information to maintain the uniqueness of elements and allow fast lookups (using hash tables).\n",
        "   - **List**: Lists are generally more memory-efficient for small collections of data or when the collection is highly repetitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **When to use a set**:\n",
        "   - When you need to ensure that elements are unique and fast membership checking is important, even if it requires slightly more memory.\n",
        "   - When you are working with a **large dataset** and need to ensure uniqueness without caring about the order.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Choose a Set Over a List:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **When you need unique elements**:\n",
        "   - Sets automatically handle uniqueness. If duplicates are not allowed, using a set ensures that only one instance of each element exists in the collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **When fast membership testing is required**:\n",
        "   - Sets provide **O(1) average time complexity** for checking if an item exists, which is much faster than lists' **O(n)** time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **When you want to perform set operations**:\n",
        "   - If you need to perform operations like **union**, **intersection**, or **difference** between collections of data, sets are ideal.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **When the order of elements does not matter**:\n",
        "   - If you do not care about the order of elements and only care about their uniqueness or fast membership testing, sets are the right choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Use Case for Sets:\n",
        "Imagine you are processing a list of email addresses, and you need to filter out duplicates:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "emails = [\"a@example.com\", \"b@example.com\", \"a@example.com\", \"c@example.com\"]\n",
        "unique_emails = set(emails)\n",
        "print(unique_emails)  # Output: {'a@example.com', 'b@example.com', 'c@example.com'}\n",
        "```\n",
        "Using a set here automatically removes duplicates without having to write custom logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Use Case for Lists:\n",
        "If you are working with a **sequence** of elements where the order matters (e.g., a list of tasks to process in a specific order), you would use a list:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "tasks = [\"task1\", \"task2\", \"task3\"]\n",

        "### What is a String in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **string** is a **sequence** of characters enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`\"`). You can also use triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) for multi-line strings.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Examples:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  string1 = \"Hello, world!\"  # Double quotes\n",
        "  string2 = 'Python is fun'  # Single quotes\n",
        "  string3 = \"\"\"This is a\n",
        "  multi-line string.\"\"\"      # Triple quotes for multi-line string\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- Strings are **immutable** in Python, meaning once a string is created, you cannot change the individual characters in it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Strings can contain any printable character, including letters, digits, spaces, and special characters like punctuation marks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- You can perform a variety of operations on strings, such as **concatenation**, **slicing**, and **searching**. Python provides several built-in methods for manipulating strings, such as `.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, etc.\n",

        "### Key Differences Between Strings and Lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mutability**:\n",
        "   - **String**: Strings are **immutable**, meaning you cannot change an individual character in a string after it is created. Any operation that modifies a string creates a new string.\n",
        "     ```python\n",

        "2. **Data Types of Elements**:\n",
        "   - **String**: A string is a sequence of characters, so it can only store text (characters).\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_string = \"hello\"\n",
        "     print(my_string)  # Output: 'hello'\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Methods Available**:\n",
        "   - **String**: Strings have a variety of methods specifically for text manipulation, such as `lower()`, `upper()`, `replace()`, `split()`, `find()`, etc.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     text = \"Hello\"\n",

        "   - **List**: Lists have methods for modifying their contents, like `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, etc.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "   - **String**: Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator, resulting in a new string.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     text1 = \"Hello\"\n",
        "     text2 = \"World\"\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Performance Considerations**:\n",
        "   - **String**: Since strings are **immutable**, any operation that modifies a string (such as concatenation or replacing characters) will create a new string, which can lead to performance overhead in certain situations.\n",
        "   - **List**: Since lists are **mutable**, operations like appending elements or modifying items in a list are generally more efficient in terms of memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of When to Use a String vs. a List:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **String Use Case**: If you're working with text data, such as storing a name or sentence, you would use a string.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  name = \"John Doe\"\n",
        "  greeting = \"Hello, \" + name\n",
        "  print(greeting)  # Output: \"Hello, John Doe\"\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **List Use Case**: If you're working with a collection of different items (like numbers or a mix of data types) and might need to modify or access them in an ordered way, you would use a list.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "  numbers.append(6)  # Adding an element to the list\n",
        "  print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **String**: A sequence of characters, immutable, used for text-based data.\n",
        "- **List**: An ordered collection of items that can store elements of different data types, mutable, and more versatile in terms of operations like adding/removing elements.\n",
        "\n",

        "In Python, **tuples** are a type of sequence, similar to lists, but they are **immutable**. This immutability ensures that once a tuple is created, its data cannot be modified. This property of immutability plays a crucial role in ensuring **data integrity** in Python. Here's a breakdown of how tuples contribute to data integrity:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Immutability of Tuples**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Immutability** means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This property guarantees that the data within the tuple remains consistent and unchanged throughout the program.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "  \n",
        "  # Attempting to change an element will raise an error\n",
        "  # my_tuple[0] = 4  # This will raise a TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  Since the tuple's contents cannot be modified, you can be confident that the data remains intact, which helps to prevent accidental or unintentional changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **No Risk of Data Corruption**\n",
        "\n",
        "- In mutable types like lists, you can inadvertently modify the data, which can lead to data corruption, especially in complex applications. Since tuples are immutable, there's no risk of accidentally changing their elements, which is important when you want to preserve the original data and avoid unwanted side effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  # Safe storage of important data\n",
        "  config = (\"localhost\", 8080, \"admin\", \"password\")\n",
        "  \n",
        "  # Since we can't change the tuple, the data remains intact\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Ensuring Consistency in Data**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Since tuples cannot be modified after creation, they can be used to represent **constant** values or data that should not be altered once set. This ensures the integrity of data when passed around in a program, especially in cases like configuration settings, constants, or as keys in dictionaries (where their hash value should remain constant).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  # Using a tuple as a key in a dictionary\n",
        "  my_dict = {(\"user\", 1): \"admin\", (\"user\", 2): \"guest\"}\n",
        "  # The tuple key cannot be altered, preserving the dictionary's integrity\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Tuple's Role in Multiple Assignment**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tuples are often used for **multiple assignment** (e.g., unpacking), where their immutability ensures that the values being unpacked remain consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)  # Unpacking a tuple\n",
        "  # Now a = 1, b = 2, c = 3. The tuple remains unchanged.\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  This is helpful when dealing with functions or operations that require returning multiple values, ensuring the returned data remains intact.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Tuples as Collection Keys in Dictionaries**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Since tuples are **hashable** (due to their immutability), they can be used as **keys in dictionaries** or elements in sets, which require data integrity. The immutability ensures that the hash value remains consistent, making the data reliable for these use cases.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- In a **multithreaded** environment, using immutable data structures like tuples can help prevent unintended modifications from different threads. Since the tuple's contents cannot be changed, multiple threads can access the same tuple without worrying about changes to its data.\n",

        "8.What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "A **hash table** is a data structure that provides a way of efficiently storing and retrieving data using a **key-value** pair system. In a hash table, each key is mapped to a specific value, and the key is processed by a **hash function** to determine its **index** in an array-like structure. This allows for very fast lookups, insertions, and deletions, typically with an average time complexity of **O(1)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the built-in **`dict`** (dictionary) data type is implemented using a hash table. This is why Python dictionaries offer fast access to values based on their keys, and also why certain rules apply to dictionary keys (e.g., they must be **hashable**).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **How a Hash Table Works**\n",
        "\n",
        "A hash table works by applying a **hash function** to a key to compute an **index** where the corresponding value is stored in an underlying array. The key is hashed into an integer, and that integer determines the \"slot\" in the hash table where the value associated with the key will be placed.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Steps in a Hash Table:\n",
        "1. **Hash Function**: The key is processed by a hash function that converts it into a unique integer (the hash value).\n",
        "2. **Index Calculation**: The hash value is used to compute the index (or \"bucket\") in the underlying array.\n",
        "3. **Storage**: The value associated with the key is stored in the calculated index.\n",
        "4. **Collision Handling**: If two keys generate the same hash value (a \"collision\"), various techniques like **chaining** (storing multiple values at the same index) or **open addressing** (finding a new empty index) are used to handle the conflict.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **How Python Dictionaries Use Hash Tables**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's built-in **`dict`** (dictionary) type is implemented using a hash table. When you insert a key-value pair into a dictionary, Python computes the hash value of the key and stores the value at the corresponding index in the underlying hash table. When you access an item in the dictionary using a key, Python hashes the key again and looks up the value at the corresponding index.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Features of Python Dictionaries and Hash Tables:\n",
        "- **Fast Lookups**: Python dictionaries allow for very efficient key-based lookups with an average time complexity of **O(1)**. This means that retrieving the value associated with a key is typically done in constant time, regardless of the size of the dictionary.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Collision Resolution**: Python handles hash collisions (when two keys hash to the same index) using a technique called **open addressing**, where Python will search for the next available slot to store the key-value pair.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Key Requirements**: In Python, the keys of a dictionary must be **hashable**, meaning they must have a fixed hash value. Typically, immutable types like **strings**, **numbers**, and **tuples** are hashable. **Lists** and other mutable types cannot be used as dictionary keys because their hash values can change during their lifetime.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of Dictionary (Hash Table) in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Creating a dictionary (which uses a hash table internally)\n",
        "my_dict = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 3}\n",
        "\n",
        "# Accessing values via keys (fast lookup)\n",
        "print(my_dict['apple'])  # Output: 1\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: Dictionary lookups, insertions, and deletions are **fast** on average, with a time complexity of **O(1)** for each operation. This makes hash tables ideal for scenarios where you need to associate keys with values and perform fast lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Unordered**: Hash tables (and therefore Python dictionaries) are **unordered** collections. The order in which items are inserted into a dictionary is not guaranteed when iterating over the dictionary, although in Python 3.7 and above, dictionaries maintain insertion order for iteration (but this is not a defining feature of hash tables in general).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Key Uniqueness**: In a dictionary, each key must be **unique**. If you try to insert a new value with a key that already exists in the dictionary, the old value is overwritten with the new one.\n",

        "\n",
        "In case of hash collisions (when two keys hash to the same index):\n",
        "- **Chaining**: One way to handle collisions is to store multiple values at the same index using a **linked list** or another data structure. This technique is used by some hash table implementations.\n",
        "- **Open Addressing**: Python uses **open addressing** for collision resolution. If a key hashes to an index that is already occupied, Python searches for the next available index (using methods like linear probing or quadratic probing).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Why Are Dictionaries in Python So Fast?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python dictionaries are efficient because they use hash tables. The key-value pairs are stored at specific indices based on the hash value of the key, enabling very fast access times. As long as the hash function distributes the keys well and the hash table does not become too full (which would lead to collisions), the operations will be quick.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Hashing in Python:\n",

        "\n",
        "10.Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "In Python, **strings are immutable**, meaning once a string object is created, its contents cannot be changed. This immutability is an important feature that plays a key role in how strings are managed in Python. Here's an explanation of why strings are immutable and the benefits that come with it:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Efficiency and Performance**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Memory optimization**: Python optimizes memory usage by reusing immutable objects. When strings are immutable, Python can safely store and share the same string value in different parts of a program without worrying about one part of the program modifying it. This reduces memory overhead because Python doesn't need to create a new object every time a string is used. Instead, it can point to the same memory location for the same string value.\n",
        "\n",
        "  For example, when two variables reference the same string:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  a = \"hello\"\n",
        "  b = \"hello\"\n",
        "  \n",
        "  # Both variables a and b reference the same memory location\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  Python will not create two separate objects for `\"hello\"`, but will point both `a` and `b` to the same memory location, saving memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **String interning**: Python performs **string interning**, where identical string literals are stored only once in memory. This works because the string is immutable, so once the string is created, it can be reused across the program. This can result in significant memory savings, especially in large programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Hashing and Usage in Dictionaries/Sets**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hashable objects**: For a string to be used as a key in a dictionary or an element in a set, it needs to be **hashable**. Immutability ensures that the hash value of the string doesn't change throughout its lifetime. This guarantees that the string can be reliably used as a key in a hash-based collection like a dictionary or a set.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  If strings were mutable, their hash value could change if the string were modified, which would break the integrity of dictionary lookups or set operations that depend on hash values remaining consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  my_dict = {\"name\": \"John\"}\n",

        "  # 'name' is a string key, and because strings are immutable, the hash value doesn't change\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Consistency and Data Integrity**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Preventing accidental modification**: By making strings immutable, Python ensures that their values cannot be changed accidentally. This means that any operation that creates a new string, such as concatenation or slicing, results in a **new string** object, rather than modifying the original one. This avoids side effects where different parts of a program might modify a string unintentionally.\n",
        "\n",
        "  For example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  s = \"hello\"\n",

        "  In this case, the original string `\"hello\"` is not altered. Instead, a new string `\"hello world\"` is created, and `s` is updated to reference it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Concurrency and Thread Safety**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Safety in multi-threaded environments**: Immutability ensures that strings are inherently thread-safe. In multi-threaded programs, if multiple threads are accessing the same string, there is no risk of one thread modifying it while another thread is reading it. This makes strings safer to use without requiring locks or other synchronization mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Simplicity in Design**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Predictability**: Because strings are immutable, developers can reason about their behavior with certainty. Once a string is created, it will always have the same value throughout its lifetime, which simplifies debugging and reasoning about code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **No side effects**: As immutable objects, strings do not produce side effects when passed to functions. A function that receives a string cannot change the original string, ensuring that the function’s behavior is more predictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of String Immutability:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "s = \"hello\"\n",
        "print(id(s))  # Print memory address (ID) of s\n",

        "# Attempting to change the string (this will not modify the original string)\n",
        "s = s + \" world\"\n",

        "Dictionaries offer several advantages over lists in Python, especially when it comes to tasks that involve key-value pair storage, fast lookups, and efficient data retrieval. Here's a breakdown of the key advantages of using dictionaries over lists for certain tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Faster Lookups (Average O(1) Time Complexity)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionaries** allow you to quickly look up values using **keys**, and this operation is usually performed in constant time, **O(1)**. This is possible because dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, which compute a hash value for each key and use it to directly access the associated value.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Lists**, on the other hand, require **O(n)** time to search for an item if you need to search by value (i.e., if you don’t know the index). This is because lists are implemented as arrays, so a lookup by value requires scanning each element sequentially until the match is found.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Example** (dictionary lookup vs list search):\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  # Dictionary\n",
        "  my_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
        "  print(my_dict[\"age\"])  # O(1) time complexity\n",

        "  # print(my_list.index(30))  # O(n) time complexity\n",
        "  ```\n",

        "### 2. **Key-Value Pair Mapping**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionaries** are specifically designed to store and manage data as **key-value pairs**, which is ideal for tasks where each element has a unique identifier (the key) associated with some value. This allows for very intuitive data modeling and access.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Lists** store only values, meaning there’s no built-in way to associate a key with a specific value. If you need to associate unique identifiers with items in a list, you would either have to use a separate list for the keys or rely on tuple-based storage, which can be less efficient and harder to manage.\n",

        "### 3. **Efficient Updates and Deletions (O(1) Average)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionaries** provide **efficient key-based updates and deletions** in constant time, **O(1)**. This means that you can modify or delete a value associated with a specific key very quickly.\n",

        "12.Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        "### Scenario: Storing Coordinates of a Geographical Location\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you are working on a program that involves managing geographical coordinates, such as storing the latitude and longitude of a location. In this case, using a **tuple** would be preferable over a **list** for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Immutability (Data Integrity)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Coordinates represent fixed values that should not change once they are set. If you were to accidentally modify the coordinates (e.g., change the latitude or longitude), it could lead to errors in your program or incorrect data. Since **tuples are immutable**, their values cannot be modified after creation, which ensures that the coordinates remain intact and unaltered throughout the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Performance (Efficiency)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Tuples** are more memory-efficient than lists. Because tuples are immutable, Python can optimize memory usage, which is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when performance is critical. In contrast, **lists** have additional overhead for supporting mutability, which makes them less efficient for storing fixed data like coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Semantic Meaning**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The use of a **tuple** communicates that the data is a fixed, unchanging collection of values. In the case of coordinates, using a tuple indicates that the latitude and longitude should always remain as a pair and will not be altered, which makes the code more readable and helps clarify the intent. This is especially useful for maintaining clear code documentation and preventing logical errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Using a tuple to store the coordinates (latitude, longitude)\n",
        "coordinates = (40.7128, -74.0060)  # New York City coordinates\n",
        "\n",
        "# Attempting to modify a tuple would raise an error\n",
        "# coordinates[0] = 41.0  # This will raise a TypeError because tuples are immutable\n",
        "\n",
        "# You can still access the values in the tuple\n",
        "latitude = coordinates[0]\n",
        "longitude = coordinates[1]\n",
        "print(f\"Latitude: {latitude}, Longitude: {longitude}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this scenario:\n",
        "- The **tuple** effectively represents a **pair** of fixed values (latitude and longitude) that should not change.\n",
        "- By using a tuple, you communicate the intent that these values are **not meant to be modified**, which leads to safer, more predictable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary of Advantages in This Scenario:\n",
        "- **Immutability**: The coordinates should not be changed once they are set, making tuples a natural choice.\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: Tuples use less memory than lists, which is important when dealing with large datasets (e.g., many geographical coordinates).\n",
        "- **Clarity**: A tuple signals that the data should remain unchanged, which is helpful for maintaining the integrity of the data and for code readability.\n",

        "13.How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "In Python, **sets** automatically handle duplicate values by **removing them**. A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements, meaning it will not store duplicate values. When you try to add a duplicate value to a set, the set simply ignores it and does not include it a second time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points About Sets and Duplicates:\n",
        "1. **No duplicates**: Sets only contain unique values. If you try to add the same value multiple times, it will only appear once in the set.\n",
        "2. **Unordered**: Sets do not maintain any order of elements. The order in which elements are added may not be the same order in which they are stored or iterated over.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of How Sets Handle Duplicates:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "- Even though the set was initialized with duplicate values (`5`, `3`), these duplicates are automatically removed.\n",
        "- The set contains only **unique** values: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Adding Duplicates:\n",
        "When you add a duplicate element to an existing set, it does not get added again:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "\n",
        "As seen in the example, even though `2` was added again using the `.add()` method, the set remains unchanged because sets automatically discard duplicate values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Are Duplicates Not Allowed in Sets?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: Sets use **hashing** to store elements. When you attempt to add an element, it checks whether that element already exists by using its hash value. If the element already exists in the set (i.e., has the same hash), it is not added again, ensuring uniqueness.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Semantics**: Sets are designed for operations where only unique values are needed, such as removing duplicates from a collection or performing mathematical set operations like unions, intersections, and differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "- **Sets automatically handle duplicates by removing them**.\n",
        "- **No duplicate values** are allowed in a set, and any attempts to add duplicates are ignored.\n",

        "- **Complex Data Modeling**: They allow for the representation of more complex relationships in data, such as a student's subjects and grades or a company's product inventory.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "A **nested dictionary** is a dictionary where some of the values are themselves dictionaries. It is useful for storing hierarchical or structured data, such as employee records, product inventories, or student details.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "In Python, **dictionaries** are implemented using a **hash table**, which allows for efficient access to elements. The time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary is **O(1)** on average, meaning that it takes constant time to retrieve the value associated with a given key, regardless of the number of items in the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time Complexity Breakdown\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Average Case (O(1))**:\n",
        "   - In the average case, accessing an element using a key is **constant time**, O(1).\n",
        "   - This is because the dictionary uses a hash table, where the key is hashed to determine its index in the underlying array. Python can then access the value directly from that position, making lookups extremely fast.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Worst Case (O(n))**:\n",
        "   - In some rare cases, the time complexity can degrade to **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the dictionary.\n",
        "   - This happens when there are **hash collisions** (i.e., multiple keys hash to the same index). When this occurs, Python must perform a search (such as using linked lists or open addressing) to find the right value, which could take longer.\n",
        "   - However, hash collisions are generally minimized by Python's dynamic resizing of the hash table and use of good hash functions, so the worst-case performance is rare and typically O(1) on average.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Is Dictionary Lookup O(1) on Average?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hashing**: When you access an element in a dictionary, Python first computes a hash value for the key using a hash function. This hash value is used to find the corresponding index in the hash table. If the key is not at the computed index, the hash table resolves the collision using a technique like linear probing or chaining.\n",
        "- **Direct Access**: Once the hash value is computed, Python can directly access the value associated with the key at that index. This makes retrieval fast and efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Dictionary Access:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Sample dictionary\n",
        "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "# Accessing the value for the key 'age'\n",
        "print(my_dict[\"age\"])  # Output: 30\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- In this case, the lookup for `\"age\"` will generally be **O(1)**, as Python will compute the hash for `\"age\"`, locate the index, and return the associated value `30` in constant time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "- **Average Time Complexity for Access**: O(1), meaning constant time.\n",
        "- **Worst-Case Time Complexity**: O(n), which can happen in the case of hash collisions, but this is rare due to Python's optimization of hash tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, dictionary lookups are highly efficient in Python, with O(1) access time for most practical scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "In Python, **lists** and **dictionaries** serve different purposes, and each is preferred in different situations depending on the requirements of your program. Here are scenarios where **lists** are generally preferred over **dictionaries**:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **When Order Matters**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lists** maintain the **order** of elements, meaning the order in which items are added is preserved, and you can access elements by their **index**.\n",
        "- If you need to maintain the order of elements or access elements based on their position (index) in a sequence, **lists** are the preferred choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",

        "- **Lists** are ideal for storing multiple items of the same type (or different types). This is especially useful when you don't need to associate values with specific keys.\n",
        "- In a **dictionary**, you would need to define a unique key for each value, which is unnecessary if you just need to store a collection of similar items.\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Lists** are designed to handle dynamic collections of data where you might need to **append** or **remove** items frequently.\n",

        "### 5. **When You Need to Support Duplicate Elements**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lists** can contain **duplicate values**. If you need a collection where the same item can appear multiple times, a list is more suitable.\n",

        "19.Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "Dictionaries in Python are considered **unordered** because, until Python 3.7, dictionaries did not guarantee the order in which key-value pairs were stored and retrieved. The insertion order of items in a dictionary was not preserved, meaning the order in which elements were added could not be relied upon when iterating over the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, starting with **Python 3.7**, dictionaries maintain the **insertion order**, meaning that items will be retrieved in the order in which they were added. This order-preserving feature was officially included in the Python language specification in Python 3.7, but dictionaries are still referred to as \"unordered\" in the official documentation because the order is not the primary feature of the data structure, and it could theoretically change in future versions.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Before Python 3.7 (Unordered)**:\n",
        "   - In earlier versions of Python (pre-3.7), dictionaries did not guarantee the order of elements when iterating over them. You could not expect the items to appear in the same order in which they were inserted.\n",
        "   - **Data retrieval**: Even though the retrieval of values associated with keys is fast (average time complexity of O(1) for lookups), the order in which items are returned during iteration was arbitrary.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example (Pre-3.7):\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_dict = {\"apple\": 1, \"banana\": 2, \"cherry\": 3}\n",
        "   for key, value in my_dict.items():\n",
        "       print(key, value)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - The output could vary, such as:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **In Python 3.7 and Later (Ordered by Insertion)**:\n",
        "   - Starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries preserve the **insertion order**. This means that when you iterate over the dictionary, the items will be returned in the order in which they were added.\n",
        "   - **Data retrieval**: The performance of retrieving data (getting values using keys) remains the same (O(1) on average), but now when you iterate over a dictionary, the order of items will be the same as when they were inserted.\n",

However, it is important to note that the **order** of dictionary items still doesn't imply that the dictionary is sorted (e.g., the dictionary will not automatically arrange items alphabetically or numerically based on keys or values).\n",

However, they are still technically \"unordered\" in the sense that they are not sorted by default, and the insertion order is not the primary feature of the dictionary. Data retrieval by keys remains O(1).\n",

        "20.Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary difference between a **list** and a **dictionary** in Python in terms of **data retrieval** is how the data is accessed and how the data structure is organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Data Structure Organization**\n",
        "- **List**:\n",
        "  - A list is an **ordered collection** of items, which means the elements are stored in a specific sequence, and each element has an associated **index**.\n",
        "  - Data is retrieved using the **index** of the element, which is an integer that specifies the position of the item in the list (starting from 0 for the first item).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionary**:\n",
        "  - A dictionary is an **unordered collection** of key-value pairs. Each item in a dictionary consists of a **key** and an associated **value**.\n",
        "  - Data is retrieved using the **key**, which can be of any immutable type (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples). The key is used to directly access the corresponding value.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Data Retrieval**\n",
        "- **List**:\n",
        "  - To retrieve data from a list, you use an **index** (an integer). This makes it efficient for accessing elements based on their position in the list.\n",
        "  - **Time Complexity**: O(1) for accessing elements by index (constant time).\n",
        "  \n",
        "  #### Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "  print(fruits[1])  # Output: banana\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  - Here, `fruits[1]` retrieves the second element (index 1), which is `\"banana\"`.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - **Limitation**: The index is always numeric and fixed, so to access specific items, you need to know their position.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionary**:\n",
        "  - To retrieve data from a dictionary, you use the **key**. The key is used to directly look up the value associated with it.\n",
        "  - **Time Complexity**: O(1) on average for retrieving data by key (constant time), since dictionaries use a **hash table** for quick lookups.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  #### Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  person = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
        "  print(person[\"age\"])  # Output: 30\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  - Here, `person[\"age\"]` retrieves the value associated with the key `\"age\"`, which is `30`.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - **Limitation**: You need to know the key to retrieve the corresponding value, but you don’t need to know its position in the collection.\n",

        "```\n",
        "- You access `\"New York\"` by using the key `\"city\"`. It’s a direct lookup and will take constant time on average.\n",

        "### 5. **When to Use Each for Data Retrieval**\n",
        "- **Use a List** when:\n",
        "  - You need to maintain the **order** of elements and need to access elements based on their **position** (e.g., lists of items, sequences).\n",
        "  - You are dealing with **duplicate values** and need to maintain all occurrences.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Use a Dictionary** when:\n",
        "  - You need **fast lookups** based on a **unique key** (e.g., a mapping from usernames to email addresses).\n",
        "  - You want to store and retrieve **key-value pairs**, where the key is meaningful (e.g., a user ID mapping to their profile details).\n",
        "  - You don’t care about the order of elements but want quick access by a unique identifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "- **List**: Data is retrieved by **index** (position in the list), and retrieval is O(1) but requires knowledge of the index.\n",
        "- **Dictionary**: Data is retrieved by **key**, which is used to directly access the corresponding value, offering O(1) retrieval time on average, but you need to know the key.\n",
        "\n",
